# Issue-of-receipt
 This code is an automation tool for a charity organization in Brazil that issues payment receipts. It uses an existing excel spreadsheet and Python to generate and send PDF receipts via WhatsApp, using several libraries like openpyxl, pyautogui and reportlab. The script includes 4 functions: formatar, enviar_msg, date and merge_duplicates, which formats numbers, sends messages, assigns date variables and groups phone numbers. It also uses images of a logo and signature, and opens WhatsApp web. Note that the script requires a GUI and correct file paths to work.
